# ADIP Ingestion Lab

This repository documents the evolution of a foundational **ADIP Ingestion Engine**,  
starting from a single-page scraper and scaling into a modular, automated, and API-integrated ingestion system. 

Each level represents a new layer of capability — reflecting my personal evolution in  
data engineering, automation, and intelligent systems design.

This repository is a progressive laboratory for building, refining, and mastering **web intelligence systems** — designed to evolve from simple HTML scrapers into fully automated, multi-layer data ingestion architectures.

Each level represents a **functional evolution** — where logic, automation, and scalability compound to form reusable intelligence pipelines.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

Each phase is a reflection of deeper system design thinking:

| **Level**	 |	**Description**   | **Core Skill**  |
| --------   | -------------------------  | ----------------|
| Level 1    |  Single-page web scraper (static extraction)           |  HTML parsing, requests, BeautifulSoup           |
| Level 2    |  Multi-page crawler (pagination & traversal)           | Crawler logic, link traversal                    |
| Level 3	 |  Automated ingestion cycles (self-refreshing scrapers) | CI/CD automation, GitHub Actions                 |
| Level 4	 |  API Ingestion Engine                                  | API requests, authentication, JSON normalization |
| Level 5	 |  Full orchestration (autonomous ingestion engine)      | Multi-source orchestration, data merging         |

This structure mirrors the way intelligent systems evolve: from reactive scripts to self-sustaining data organisms.

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Data Ingestion Lab** is a foundational milestone in the broader **ADIP (Automated Data Intelligence Platform)** architecture.  
It demonstrates the evolution of autonomous data pipelines capable of ingesting, cleaning, and unifying multi-source information — forming the core of adaptive, intelligent systems.
